        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hey! My name is Aneesh Atri and I'm a sophomore pursuing a BS in Computer Science at Northeastern University. I really enjoy solving problems and I think that the field of Computer Science is perfect for someone like me. I'm extremely motivated to learn about new technologies and how to use them effectively to solve problems. I've grown to enjoy the process of developing and building because I feel a sense of satisfaction after I have a major breakthrough or get something to work. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to technology, I also have a passion for business. Right now, I'm working on establishing a consulting organization at my school that does work for non-profit clients. In the future, I know that I'd definitely like to be working at the nexus between business and technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of coding and business, I like to play golf and hang out with my friends. I'm a huge foodie and I love to explore new cuisines. I find the process of cooking extremely relaxing and I admire the passion with which chefs like J. Kenji Lopez-Alt and David Chang push the boundaries of cuisine as we know it.
